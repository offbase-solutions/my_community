# Stakify Workflow 5: Choose Design Path

## AI Agent Configuration

### Operation Mode

```yaml
execution_mode: human_in_loop  # Always requires human decision
checkpoints:
  before_execution: true
  decision_required: true
  on_error: true
auto_proceed:
  agent_artifacts: true
  deliverables: false
```

### Task Definition

**Primary Goal**: Choose between Path 1 (Generate Stitch Prompts) or Path 2 (Already Have Designs)

**CRITICAL**: This is a **DECISION POINT** - NO files are created

**Prerequisites Check**:
- Step 4 completed (Product Documentation exists)
- PROD-DOC-01 Section 4 has feature breakdown
- Understanding of Google Stitch

**Success Criteria**:
- Path chosen (1 or 2)
- User understands implications
- Ready to proceed to Step 6

## Decision Tree

### Question: Do you already have Google Stitch designs?

**NO** → Choose **Path 1: Generate Stitch Prompts First**
- Step 6.2 will generate detailed design prompts
- You'll create designs in Google Stitch using those prompts
- VLG Pass 1 uses 3 inputs (prompts + screenshot + HTML)

**YES** → Choose **Path 2: Already Have Stitch Designs**
- Skip Step 6.2 (no prompt generation)
- Use existing designs directly
- VLG Pass 1 uses 2 inputs (screenshot + HTML only)

## Path 1: Generate Stitch Prompts First

**When to Use**:
- ✅ You don't have designs yet
- ✅ You want AI-generated design specifications
- ✅ You want design rationale documented
- ✅ Starting completely fresh

**Process Flow**:
```
Step 6.2: AI generates stitch-prompts.md
    ↓
You: Use prompts in Google Stitch
    ↓
You: Download screenshots + HTML
    ↓
Step 7.1: VLG Pass 1 (3 inputs)
```

**Benefits**:
- Design rationale documented
- Specifications consistent
- Easy to regenerate
- Maximum AI context

## Path 2: Already Have Stitch Designs

**When to Use**:
- ✅ Already created designs in Stitch
- ✅ Have HTML + screenshots ready
- ✅ Design decisions implicit in visuals
- ✅ Don't need AI specifications

**Process Flow**:
```
Skip Step 6.2
    ↓
You: Upload existing designs
    ↓
Step 7.1: VLG Pass 1 (2 inputs)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️ No documented design rationale
- ⚠️ VLG must infer decisions
- ⚠️ Harder to regenerate
- ✅ Faster if designs exist

## Agent Task

**Agent Responsibilities**:
1. Present decision tree clearly
2. Explain implications of each path
3. Record user's choice
4. Document decision in agent artifacts
5. Configure next workflow accordingly

**No File Creation** - This is decision only

## Agent Artifacts

**Auto-Generated** (stored in `docs/agent-gen/phase-3-step-5/`):
- `decision_summary.md` - Path chosen and reasoning
- `next_steps.md` - Configured workflow based on choice
- `step_summary.md` - Decision checkpoint

## Next Step

**If Path 1 chosen**: Proceed to **Workflow 6 - Generate Feature Docs** (will include Step 6.2)
**If Path 2 chosen**: Proceed to **Workflow 6 - Generate Feature Docs** (will skip Step 6.2)

## Human Decision Required

🔴 **REQUIRED**: User must choose Path 1 or Path 2

**Questions to Ask User**:
1. Do you have Google Stitch designs already created?
2. Do you want AI to generate detailed design prompts?
3. Do you want design rationale documented?

**Record Decision**:
- Path chosen: {1 or 2}
- Reasoning: {user explanation}
- Confidence: {High/Medium/Low}
